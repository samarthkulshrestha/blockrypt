## Introduction

<img src="assets/xkcd_blockchain.png" align="right" style="margin: 16px;" />

"The fastest way to learn how blockchains work is to build one", says
[Hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com/). **Blockrypt** is a blockchain that I
built to understand how blockchains function.

A blockchain is an immutable, sequential chain of records called Blocks.
They can contain transactions, files or any data you like, really. But the
important thing is that theyâ€™re chained together using hashes.

## Requirements

+ Make sure that [Python](https://www.python.org/) v3.6+ (along with
[pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)) is installed.

+ Install the required pip packages by running:

```
pip install Flask==2.3.2 requests==2.29.0
```

+ An HTTP Client (for example[Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) or
[cURL](https://curl.se/)) is also needed.

## Running

+ Clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/samarthkulshrestha/blockrypt.git
```

+ Enter the `blockrypt` directory.

```
cd blockrypt/
```

+ Run Blockrypt.

```
python src/blockrypt.py
```

You will be asked for a port number. Here, enter the port you want to run
Blockrypt on. The port must be idle.
