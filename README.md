## Introduction

<img src="assets/xkcd_blockchain.png" align="right" style="margin: 16px;" />

"The fastest way to learn how blockchains work is to build one", says
[Hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com/). **Blockrypt** is a blockchain that I
built purely to understand how blockchains work.

## Requirements

+ Make sure that [Python](https://www.python.org/) v3.6+ (along with
[pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)) is installed.

+ Install the required pip packages by running:

```
pip install Flask==2.3.2 requests==2.29.0
```
